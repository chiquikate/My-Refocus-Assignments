I am Chiqui Kate S. Ordu√±a, 28 years old, and I'm a licensed dentist.

My hobbies are watching movies and series. If I have time, I also do photography and videography.

My ultimate goal for this year is to build my portfolio in web developing. First, I want to build my own website for my passion (Photography and Videography). To post my travel videos, blogs and pictures in my own web design is a dream. I also want to make a website for our dental clinic and to build like a web app for schedule making and many more.

I want to learn new skills. I want to make a change on my career path, a career where I can see myself improving and growing. I honestly saw that in web developing. It's really hard at first since I came from a medical field with zero to little knowledge in tech field. But I'm really trying because I love what I'm doing here, tho it's frustrating sometimes. HAHA.

I do really hope I will succeed in this career path. I pray that I can overcome all the frustrations and disappointments, and make this as a motivation to move forward and not to step back and give up.
